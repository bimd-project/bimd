# The Belgian Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2001 and 2011 (BIMD2001 and BIMD2011)

**The Belgian deprivation indices** are spatial- and time-specific measures of relative deprivation on the level of the smallest geographical unit in Belgium, the statistical sector. The development of the deprivation indices was one of the goals of the ELLIS project (https://www.brain-ellis.be/) and was funded by the Belgian Federal Science Policy (BELSPO) through the BRAIN-be 2.0 programme. 

The BIMD2001 and BIMD2011 rank statistical sectors from 1 (most deprived) to 18 295 or 18 764 (least deprived), and assign these ranks into deciles – from the most deprived 10 percent of statistical sectors nationally to the least deprived 10 percent. 
The indices combine information from six domains, measuring different types of dimensions of deprivation and including income, employment, education, housing, health and crime. The domains are combined to produce the overall relative measure of deprivation, **the BIMD2001 and the BIMD2011**. The range of measures we provide here include scores, ranks, and deciles for each domain and the overall BIMDs. Higher geographical level summary measures are also available for municipalities and they include average score, average rank, and extent. 
## What is the use of the domains and the BIMD2001 and the BIMD2011?
The domains can be used on their own to investigate specific aspects of deprivation (e.g. income or education), whereas the BIMD2001 and BIMD2011 can be used for researching the overall socio-economic deprivation. 
The ranks can be directly compared – the closer the statistical sector’s rank is to 1, the more deprived it is. To identify the most deprived statistical sectors nationally (by a specific domain or the BIMDs) the published deciles can be used. It is important to note that the indices are not designed to provide a comparability in time – they provide a comparison based on the rankings as determined at a certain time point by each version of the index. For instance, a statistical sector can be said to have become less deprived relative to other statistical sectors if it was within the most 10 percent of statistical sectors nationally according to the BIMD2001, but within the most deprived 30 percent according to the BIMD2011.  
## What data files and supporting materials are available? 
###### Data 
We publish the dataset containing scores, ranks and deciles for all domains and for the overall BIMD2001 and BIMD2011. All on the level of statistical sector. 
###### R codes
There are number of R files containing codes that were applied to create the domains and overall BIMD2001 and the BIMD2011. Althouth we are not able to publish the raw data due to privacy issue, you are encouraged to inspect our codes and methodology. Using our codes and published dataset, you are, however, able to make your own changes in the BIMD2001 and BIMD2011. For instance, you can re-calculate the overall indices without using the health domain, if the research interest is in investigating the health inequalities. You can also reassign the ranks into quantiles rather than deciles. In addition, we provide R codes for calculating the summary measures at the level of municipality that includes average score, average rank and extent.
